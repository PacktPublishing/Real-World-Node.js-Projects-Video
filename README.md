# Real World Node.js Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real World Node.js Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/business/server-side-programming-nodejs-beginners-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788476126), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Node.js is a performance-efficient server-side platform which makes writing backend code simple and fun. Since it is written in JavaScript, it is the perfect tool for full-stack development because it allows you to have your entire codebase in one language.

In this course, you will learn a broad range of skills to build high-performance real-world applications with MERN Stack. You will start by developing a voting application, focusing on server-side tasks with Node.js and Express and then communicating from the server-side to the client with EJS. Then you will learn about WebSockets and real-time communication, which will lead on to developing a full-stack messaging application. Next, you will discover microservices and cloud storage with AWS and upload assets, such as images, video files, documents, and more.

Moving on, you will create a Node.js API and interact with it using the very popular library, React. Ultimately, this will lead to your creating a full-stack shopping application and connecting it to the backend API using the MERN stack. By the end of the course, you will have adapted to using a broad range of Node.js skills and JavaScript technologies to create highly performant, full-stack applications.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
<br/>
This course benefits JavaScript developers with a basic understanding of Node.js. They should be familiar with the basics of any database (though MongoDB will give you the most edge in this course). Familiarity with communication between the server and client-side of an application would be an added advantage but is not necessary.
